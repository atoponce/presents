<div class="handout container">
<p>These are some thoughts and ideas that I have been working on over the past
few years. The goal of this subject is to provide a metric that people can
use to identify the strength of their passwords</p>
<p>Cryptanalysis of Passwords: The subject will cover just a couple of the
many tools that are used to defeat passwords. Some theory and metrics will
be covered.</p>
<p>Defeating Encrypted Filesystems: Lastly, we'll learn the tools and steps
necessary to defeat encrypted filesystems using the Cold Boot Attack and
the Evil Maid Attack.</p>

<li>Goal: Education</li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">This presentation and lecture will cover how do defeat passwords on any
Unix-like operating system if you have physical access to the machine.
We'll cover getting root on the box with little effort and time. After
gaining root access, we'll discuss unshadowing passwords on the system
using strong tools. We'll also look at defeating encrypted filesystems
that are common on many latops and government furnished computers.</p>
<p class="handout">DISCLAIMER: This lecture is not intended to teach you how to crack
machines for illegal reasons. Rather, the intent of this presentation
is to teach system administrators and users alike how they can guard
themselves against such attacks. As Stan Lee immortalized:</p>
<blockquote class="handout">
&quot;With great power there must also come -- great responsibility.&quot;</blockquote>
<p class="handout">The attacks documented in this presentation are for informational
purposes only, and the author holds no responsibility for the actions
of his students.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide" id="getting-root">
<h1>Getting Root</h1>
<ul class="slides simple">
<li>Physical access? Security is compromised!!!</li>
<li>Runlevels - single user mode</li>
<li>Interact with the boot loader</li>
<li>Boot from a live medium (LiveCD)</li>
<li>Flash the BIOS</li>
<li>Chain cutters</li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">It's important to understand that when you have physical access to a
computer, any and all security has been compromised! It doesn't matter
about the operating system- Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, BSD or Windows. If
you have physical access, then you have immediate access to the data.</p>
<p class="handout">All that is required, is interacting with the boot loader, telling the
kernel to boot the system into single user mode. Single user mode is
necessary, and it drops the user to a root shell, without
authenticating as root. At this point, the root filesystem has been
mounted, and the data is at the mercy of the user at the machine.</p>
<p class="handout">If you decide to password-protect your boot loader, which is possible
on many bootloaders, the attacker could just boot off another medium
rather than the hard disk to get at the data. At which point, he could
either mount the filesystem, and remove the password restriction, or
chroot to the mounted filesystem, and start working.</p>
<p class="handout">You could protect your BIOS, by also password protecting it, so it only
boots from the hard disk, and nothing else. This is common in
universities, for example, who don't want students playing around with
the system. The way around this, is to either flash the BIOS by moving
jumpers, or pulling power. Or, because you have physical access, you
could just remove the drives and clone them to another drive for
further processing.</p>
<p class="handout">Then of course, you could have the case locked down under lock and key.
All I need is my lockpick set and some knowledge picking locks. If you
chain it down, I'll bring my chain cutters.</p>
<p class="handout">You see the point. If an attacker has physical access to the machine,
your data is compromised. No ifs, ands or buts about it.</p>
<p class="handout">Or is there?</p>
<p class="handout">Some hard drives come with hard drive passwords, which if forgotten,
cannot be reset, even by the manufacturer. They are hardware-based, not
software-based. So, even if you pulled out the drive, and plugged it
into your new computer, you would still be asked for the drive
password. Again, even manufacturers can't get around it in some cases.</p>
<p class="handout">Further, encrypted filesystems guard against these attacks. Regardless
of a BIOS password, GRUB password, and so forth, ultimately, before the
root filesystem can be mounted, and therefore decrypted, the user must
supply the key to decrypted the filesystem. If the key is unknown, the
data is safe. Even powerful electron microscopes would be no good, as
the encoded data on the platter is encrypted. We'll discuss this a bit
more at length later in this presentation.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">Attacking passwords on systems can happen using a variety of methods.
The most common form of attack is known as a dictionary attack. This
attack is done by sending password guesses by means of an attacking
program to either the login process or against a password database. Of
course, if the password database stores passwords in plain text, there
is no need for the attacking software. If the password is hashed, as is
usually the case, then we need to guess passwords, comparing our hash
against the database. If the hashes match, we found our password. It's
referred to as a &quot;dictionary attack&quot;, because we are using common words
found in a dictionary, and comparing the results against that in the
database.</p>
<p class="handout">Passwords should be audited on a regular basis by system
administrators. Password auditing can ensure that users are using
strong and long passwords to prevent dictionary attacks, should one be
mounted.</p>
<p class="handout">Strong passwords include not only lowercase letters, but uppercase,
numbers and special characters in the passwords. However, the longer a
password is, the more entropy the password carries. Entropy refers to
the direct measure of the randomness of the password. An example can be
illustrated as follows:</p>
<p class="handout">Suppose we use only the 26 characters in the English alphabet,
lowercase only. Suppose our password is 5 characters long. This
means that there are 26 possible letters each character could be:</p>
<p class="handout"><tt class="docutils literal">26 26 26 26 26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or 26^5 (26 to the 5th power)</tt></p>
<p class="handout">This means there could be a possible 11,881,376 passwords. Now,
imagine that we've added uppercase, numbers and all 32 special
characters to the potential realm of characters. This means there
could be 94 possible characters for each character in the password:</p>
<p class="handout"><tt class="docutils literal">94 94 94 94 94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or 94^5 (94 to the 5th power)</tt></p>
<p class="handout">This is a grand total of only 7,339,040,224. While the search space
is substatially larger, suppose you had a 6-character password,
rather than 5. With 94 possible characters, the search space just
expanded to 689,869,781,056. That's some serious exponential
growth! Now, let's look at an 8 character password:</p>
<p class="handout">6,095,689,385,410,816 possible passwords! So, while adding &quot;leet
speak&quot; does add entropy, entropy exponentially grows with length
over just increasing the pool of characters to draw from.</p>

<h1>Password Theory</h1>
<ul class="slides simple">
<li>Cryptanalysis</li>
<li>Password structures</li>
<li>Strength qualities</li>
<li>Entropy</li>
<li>Implementations</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout container">
<p>The structure of the presentation will be as follows:</p>
<p>Cryptanalysis: In order to understand what a &quot;strong password&quot; is, we
need to understand what software is used and how it is used to attack
passwords. This will help us get a handle on what qualifies a password
as strong versus weak.</p>
<p>Password structures: We'll cover how passwords are stored in databases,
hard drives, and mediums. We'll cover passwords stored in plain text,
verses hashed passwards, versus salted passwords. Briefly.</p>
<p>We'll also take what we learned about how they are stored,
and start looking at the numbers and combinations of passwords. This
will prepare us for learning about entropy, which is coming up. We'll
also add rainbow tables to the mix, and why salted passwords increase
the strength of your password.</p>
<p>Strength qualities: After analyzing how to attack passwords, we can get
a sense of what makes passwords strong versus weak. We learn quickly
that length becomes a key factor as well as adding different character
sets to the password.</p>
<p>Entropy: This is to cover the amount of work it takes for an attacker
to get access to your account if he knows your username, and is only
guessing your password. We'll see how length adds much more entropy to
a password than just adding random characters. We'll run some numbers
on the time it would take to crack these passwords.</p>
<p>Implementations: We'll look at some various password managers and how
you can keep your password safe, while easily accessible at the same
time.</p>

<div class="slide" id="password-requirements">
<h1>Password Requirements</h1>
<ol class="slides arabic simple">
<li>&quot;Strong&quot; (whatever that means)</li>
<li>Easy to remember</li>
<li>Unique for each account</li>
<li>Stored securely</li>
</ol>
<div class="handout container">
<p>We're told that we need to make our passwords &quot;strong&quot;, but defining
what &quot;strong&quot; means seems to confuse people. Some will say that a
strong password is a long password. Others might say that a password
uses a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and
punctuation. Others, maybe more anal retentive, will say a strong
password is one that is built entirely off random characters.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I think we can do better, and we will. Later on, we'll
quantify exactly what it means to have a &quot;strong&quot; password</p>
<p>Having a &quot;strong&quot; password and one that is easy to remember seem to
conflict each other. The reason for this seems obvious. If I generate a
&quot;strong&quot; password, then in becomes more difficult to remember. The
stronger the password it semes, the harder it is to recall from memory.
So naturally, we want to keep our password easy to remember, so we sort
of compromise on the strength of the password to accomplish this aim.</p>
<p>Case in point, and part of the motivation for developing password
theory; I had a friend who is in the computer science field. He's even
a mathematician at Weber State. Recently, he had his Gmail account
compromised by an attacker. The attacker was able to crack his
password, and take out the account. The reason the attacker got the
password was because it wasn't &quot;strong&quot;, but instead, easy to remember.
It was a valuable lesson to him to change his password strength, not
only for Gmail, but for the other accounts he had.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I'll be able to show that by the end of this presentation,
you can have both a very strong password, and one that's easy to
remember.</p>
<p>Of course, if a password does get access to the password for our
account, the last thing we want him to have access to is our bank
account, or other accounts that we might consider a sensitive nature.</p>
<p>So, it's a good idea to create a unique password for each account that
we have. However, this also seems to be in disagreement with having
passwords that are easy to remember. I'm sure each of us have many
accounts that we interface with. Is it easy to remember which password
goes with which account? It might be if we interface with those
accounts daily, but what about the accounts that we only access once a
month, or even less than that? Forgotten passwords are very common.</p>
<p>At least having an unique password for each account guarantees that if
one account gets compromised, the others won't be compromised. Again,
hopefully I'll be able to show that not only can you have a &quot;strong&quot;
password that's easy to remember, but it will be easy to remember
&quot;strong&quot; passwords for every account you have.</p>
<p>In reality, passwords are only as secure as their storage, with the
most secure storage being your brain. However, you can write passwords
down in a secure manner. You could have an encrypted database with one
single master password that contains all your account passwords. Unless
someone knows the master password, they won't get access to the others.
You could also store your passwords in your wallet or purse, as these
items are likely the most tracked items in your possession, minus maybe
your kids.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of implementations, both software and hardware, for
storing your passwords securely, and it can be done. We'll look at some
methods towards the end of this presentation for securely storing your
passwords.</p>

<div class="handout container">
<p>In order to get some sort of sense on what makes a password &quot;strong&quot;,
we need to look at the amount of effort it takes to attack a password
from a cryptanalysis point-of-view.</p>
<p>Cryptanalysis is a branch of cryptography that studies breaking down
encrypted data without the access to the secret algorithms that were
used to generate that encrypted data. These methods use a variety of
algorithms and theoris, such as birthday attacks, rainbow tables (of
which we'll talk about here), boomerang attacks, brute force attacks
and other methods.</p>
<p>By analyzing some of the cryptanalysis methods used to attack and
recover passwords from encrypted means will help us get a handle on the
hardware and software implementations needed to make these attacks
practical, which means we might get a better understanding what it
means to have a &quot;strong&quot; password.</p>
<p>Hashes are one-way algorithms which take any form of data, and produce a
unique hexadecimal string of characters. If the same data is provided to
the hashing algorithm, the same hexadecimal string will always be
produced. This means that there is a one-to-one relationship with the
data and the hash.</p>
<p>Mathematically speaking, if a function is &quot;one-to-one&quot;, then an inverse
exists to reach the domain from the range. However, in cryptography,
this logic doesn't necessarily hold. For example, suppose my function
truncates data. Even though the output is unique for the input, unless
you know additional information about the system, and which data was
truncated, you won't have everything needed to apply an inverse
function to get to the original data.</p>
<p>Hashes are one-to-one, but they are also one-way, meaning that it's
trivial to create the hash, but we shouldn't be able to go in reverse.
In other words, we can't take a hash, and reproduce the data that
created it. An analogy to this would be creating pie crust. It takes
water, flour, sugar and other ingredients. It's easy to create the
dough, and eventually the crust by mixing the ingredients, but it's
near impossible to take a crust, and reduce it to the ingredients
necessary to create it. This is partly due to evaporation of water
during heating in the oven, chemical bonding, and other factors.</p>
<p>Because the relationship to the data and the hash is one-to-one (1:1),
this means we could create a database of text that produces the unique
hash. Although we can't reverse the hash into the data, we can look up
the hash in the database, and if we find a match, then we know what the
data is that produced the hash. These databases are known as rainbow
tables. You can find many large and small rainbow tables on the
Internet.</p>
<p>In order to work around rainbow tables, passwords are salted. Suppose a
password is 8 characters long. It contains exactly one unique hash.
However, what if we were to add a &quot;salt&quot; to the password string.
Suppose the password salt is 6 characters in length and that the salt
uses a base-64 character set. Then, this means that the password could
produce 64^6 possible hashes. This would make our rainbow table 64^6
times as large.</p>
<p>64^6 = 68719476736</p>
<p>If all we have access to is the hash, and not the salt, then we have a
64^6 possible combinations to search through with the salt, assuming it
is indeed 6 characters long, to find the right password that produced
that hash. This makes rainbow tables infeasible.</p>
<p>Further, most passwords in databases and operating systems are
&quot;shadowed&quot;. This means that only the database or operating system
administrator will have access to the salted password hash. This keeps
prying eyes of regular system users away from attempting to attack the
hash, and find the password that produced it. We assume that the
database and operating system administrators can be trusted, due to the
nature of their job.</p>
<p>If we can get access to a shadowed password, then we will also likely
have access to the salt. This means that we've got enough data to begin
searching for a string of data that produced the hash (combined with the
salt appropriately, of course). One such tool to do this is John the
Ripper. John the Ripper takes an &quot;unshadowed&quot; file- that is the
username, the salt, and the hashed password, along with some other
metadata, to begin attacking the password. It does so through brute
force.</p>
<p>John the Ripper reads a database of words to attack from, or it can
start using incremental mode. The &quot;database&quot; of words can be a regular
text file with one word per line, that is commonly used in spell checker
programs to assure spelling accuracy. You can also supply options to
John to reduce the search space, such as restricted character sets,
suspected password length, and potential dictionary databases to search
from.</p>
<p>John the Ripper is designed to be fast. It can take advantage of
multiple cores in your CPU, to linearly increase the speed. On my 16
core system at work, I can achieve a speed of 192,000 passwords per
second. With a cluster of 20 machines, with 16 cores a piece, this means
I can achieve a speed of 3,840,000 passwords per second.</p>
<p>For an 8-character password, this means at this pace, it would take 59
years at most to find the right key, combined with that salt, to match
the hash given in the shadowed password database. We'll talk more about
this in a bit.</p>

<p>Above is an example of the text 'foo' hashed with the MD5 hashing
algorithm, compared to hashing 'Foo' and 'goo'. Notice how all the
hashing strings are radically different from one another. The
difference of letter case matters, as can be seen with 'f' and 'F'.
However, the capital letter 'F' compared to the lowercase letter 'f'
are several bytes apart, as far as the computer is concerned, even if
only one bit is flipped. However, the letter g is one character from
the letter f, so you would expect the hash to be much more similar, but
it's just as radically different.</p>
<p>This is known as 'The Avalanche Effect'. Even the slightest change in
the source input, has a massive effect on the output.</p>
<p>As mentioned with hashing algorithms, they are one way functions,
meaninig that it's asy to take any stream of data, binary or otherwise,
and get a hash from that stream. However, it should be impossible, or
highly improbable, to reverse the hash into the originating data.</p>
<p>Further, hashes should be computationally secure, meaning that it
should be able to stand against cryptanalysis attacks and there should
be no collisions in the hash. A collision is given, when many different
streams of data provide the same hash. Of course collisions will
exist, due to the infinite nature of the data, and the finite nature
of the hash. However, the 128-bit MD5 algorithm can produce
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 unique hashes.
This should be large enough to avoid unnecessary or frequent

</ul>
<p class="handout">First some definitions:</p>
<ul class="handout simple">
<li>A shadowed password is a password stored in a database that is only
readable by the root user on a Unix or Linux machine. Unix didn’t
implement shadowed passwords until 1988 with AT&amp;T SystemV R3.2 and
BSD 4.3 Reno in 1990.</li>
<li>A salted password is a password that uses a random string of text that
is used as a seed to build an encrypted hash. Passwords on Unix and
Linux are hashed with this salt as a seed. The salt is passed to the
hashing algorithm as an argument appended or prepended to the
password text itself.</li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">Most Unix and Linux systems are shadowed by default. Some aren't, like
HP/UX, which stores the accounts and the password in the
<tt class="docutils literal">/etc/passwd</tt> file. Only root can read the contents of the shadowed
password file, to prevent security breaches, such as password attacks
against accounts on the system.</p>
<p class="handout">Further, most passwords on Unix and Linux systems are salted. The salt
increases the search space dramatically when performing password
attacks. It works in this manner:</p>
<p class="handout">First, the salt, as already mentioned, is just a random string of
characters that are either appended or prepended to the password
itself. This newly created string is then hashed, and hashes are
compared to those on the filesystem. If the hash maches, the password
has been entered correctly.</p>
<p class="handout">So, what is this random string of characters? It is chosen from a list
of 64 possible characters. All lowercase letters, uppercase letters,
zero through nine, the period and the forward slash. But why use the
salt? What security does it add to the password?</p>
<p class="handout">Suppose a salt was not used. Of course, any developer worth his salt
(pun intended) will hash the password in the database rather than store
it in plain text. Because hashes are one way, we should not be able to
derive the source text out of a hash. As a result, we need to re-hash
the source text, compare it against what is in the database, and see if
they match. Because the same source text will always produce the same
resulting hash, this algorithm is bullet proof.</p>
<p class="handout">Or is it?</p>
<p class="handout">What is preventing me, for example, from creating a database table of
source text and resulting hashes? This way, rather than brute force the
password by trying every possible combination that it could be, I just
just check to see if the hash in the password database is already in my
hash database. This hash database is known as a 'rainbow table', and
checking the table for matching hashes is known as a 'rainbox table
attack'. One source text to one resulting hash. Always and every time.</p>
<p class="handout">This is problematic, so adding a salt to the password string
complicates the rainbow table. For example, suppose I just added one
character as a salt to my password. Because that character can be one
of 64 characters, this means there could be a possible 64 resulting
hashes from the same source text. What if I had two characters in my
salt. 64*64 or 64^2 = 4096 potential passwords. My rainbow table is
growing exponentially per password.</p>
<p class="handout">On my Linux box, I have 8 characters in my salt. This means that there
are 64^8 potential hashes my password could be. That's
281,474,976,710,656 potential hashes for a single source text!! Can you
imagine a rainbow table containing that sort of data?</p>
<p class="handout">For your information, there is an online distributed computing project
computing such rainbow tables. You can find more info at:</p>

</ul>
<div class="handout container">
<p>This is an example of a shadowed password from the <tt class="docutils literal">root</tt> account on a
Unix server. Each field in the line is separated by a colon. Thus, we
can break down the line as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">root</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">:$1$NSESuz4A$22uWH1mOPnka4zTdnx3jx1:</tt></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">$1$NSESuz4A$22uWH1mOPnka4zTdnx3jx1</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The password is further divided into subfield separated by dollar
signs. Let's lookt at each one:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">$1</tt> - Tells us the MD5 hashing algorithm is used for the hash.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">$NSESuz4A</tt> - Is the salt used with the password for the algorithm.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">$22uWH1mOPnka4zTdnx3jx1</tt> - The actual hash of the salted password.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the salt is 8 characters in length. On Unix-like
systems, the salt uses a character base of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[a-zA-z0-9./]</span></tt>. This means
there are a total of 64 possible characters that each element in the
salt can be. So, the salt added with the password could produce 64^8 or

<h1>Cracking Password Databases</h1>
<ul class="slides simple">
<li>John the Ripper</li>
<li>Dictionary files</li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">So, now we're at the juicy details. How do we crack these passwords?
We've already gotten root on the box, now we want passwords. Why? Well,
if I can get passwords off one system, chances are good I can get the
same password to work for that account on many systems. Maybe even
online services. So, the data I'm about to retrieve could be quite
valuable.</p>
<p class="handout">John the Ripper is probably the best dictionary attacking software
available. <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt>, as it's commonly referred to, is Free Software,
licensed under the GPL. As a result, most up-to-date Unix-like
operating systems have <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> available in their software
repositories. If John is not available for your operating system, you
can grab the source code at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">http://www.openwall.com/john/</a>, and compile
for your architecture.</p>
<p class="handout">John the Ripper is very configurable and contains a decent set of
features. One useful feature is providing a wordlist, or dictionary
file for it to use before going into intremental mode. Wordlists can be
found all over the Internet, and your operating system might even
include its own wordlist as a database for spell checking. Full
wordlists can be downloaded or purchased on CD from the same site where
you downloaded <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt>, namely: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/">http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/</a>.</p>
<p class="handout">First, before <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> can operate, you need to &quot;unshadow&quot; the system.
This requires having access to both the account database and the
password database. Typically, these are /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
respectively. By unshadowing the system, you are placing the password
in the account database in a copy local to you. <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> then reads
this unshadowed file, and stars working, either from a wordlist your
provided, for running in incremental mode.</p>
<p class="handout"><tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> has some useful options, such as telling it the minimum length
of the password in the unshadowed file (if you know such information)
as well as a maximum length. This can cut down on the search space, and
ultimately the time it takes to attack the password. John also has the
capability of logging a session, keeping track of its progress. Should
for for eany reason <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> quit executing prematurely, you can
restore your previous search session, thus avoiding to redo work you've
already done.</p>

<div class="handout container">
<p>John the Ripper is a utility for cracking passwords. It takes a
wordlist and an unshadowed password dababase file, and attempts to
recover the password by hashing the entries in the word list and
matching them to the entry in the unshadowed password file.</p>
<p>As we already discovered, the shadowed password contains a bit of
information. It shows is the hashing algorithm used to create the hash,
it gives us the salt that is combined with the password, and of course
it gives us the hashed password.</p>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> gets an entry from the wordlist, it looks for the hashing
algorthim it needs to use on this account, grabs the salt, combines the
salt and the wordlist entry together, hashes the combined result, and
compares that hash to what is in the unshadowed file. If the hash
matches, then we have found our password. If it doesn't match, then we
continue working our way through the wordlist in a like manner until we
find a match.</p>
<p>If we exhaust the word list and haven't found a match, then <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt>
will go into incremental mode, meaning it will start with 'a' then 'b'
through 'z', then try 'aa', 'ab' through 'zz', then 'aaa' etc until a
match has been found.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> can take advantage of a multiple CPU/core system. It's trivial
to have one CPU/core work on one wordlist, a different CPU/core work on
a different wordlist, etc. Hashing the text is the most computationally
intensive operation, so you could have different CPUs/cores working on
hashing texts of different lengths. <tt class="docutils literal">john</tt> is very configurable, with
many more options, to speed up the process for searching for passwords.</p>
<p>Wordlists can be obtained from the developers of John the Ripper.
Relatively small wordlists are given away for free, while a nominal
charge is required for larger wordlists. Other wordlists around the
Internet could be found, the largest of which might contain 2-3 million
entries. Of course, your operating system likely already ships with a
wordlist that spell checkers use as their dictionary database. Check
the documentation for your operating system for more information.</p>

<p class="handout">While <tt class="docutils literal">RedSox</tt> is technically not a &quot;dictionary word&quot;, because it is
two dictionary words combined together, this is another example of a

<p class="handout"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B1gbRother|$alw4ysriGHt!?</span></tt> is an example of a very strong password.
It uses random capitalization, uses inconsistent character and letter
substitution and it is extremely long, with 26 characters. It's based
on a passphrase rather than a password.</p>
<p class="handout"><tt class="docutils literal">deer2010</tt> is another example of a weak password. Words, especially
dictionary words, with numbers appended at the end can be easily tested
with very little lost time.</p>
<p class="handout">The word <tt class="docutils literal">l33th4x0r</tt> is a medium-weak password. First off, it's
common in the hacker and geek community to refer to themselves as
&quot;elite hackers&quot;, or &quot;l33t h4x0rs&quot;. Also, the substitution of characters
for numbers and punctuation is not random, but consistent. &quot;l33t&quot;
dictionaries can easiy be created from standard dictionary wordlists.</p>
<p class="handout">The word <tt class="docutils literal">!Aaron08091977Keri|</tt> is a medium password in terms of
strength. It's not based on a dictionary word, and it incorporates
length, a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and
punctuation. However, if the couple is being targeted for their
passwords, this string could be generated without much loss of time.</p>
<p class="handout">Common strings such as <tt class="docutils literal">PassWord</tt> are horrible passwords, and can be
easily guessed in mere seconds if appropriate hardware is used to crack
the password. Even with the capitalization of a couple of letters.</p>
<p class="handout">The word <tt class="docutils literal">4pRte!aii&#64;3</tt> is an example of a very strong password for a
few resions. First, the appearance of the letters, numbers and
punctuation appears to be entirely random. Also, notice the <tt class="docutils literal">ii</tt> in
the password. Using a letter twice in succession helps avoid &quot;shoulder
snooping&quot;, where someone over your shoulder might be trying to figure
out your password based on where your fingers land. Because it is very
difficult to see multiple presses of consecutive letters if typed
quickly, this can add a great deal of strength to the password. It's
best to not repeat the letter more than twice, however.</p>
<p class="handout">Regardless of the string, repeated characters over and over in the
password give a very weak password, such as <tt class="docutils literal">passpasspass</tt>. Repeated
strings can be concatenated quickly from large wordlists, and cost the
attacker very little.</p>
<p class="handout">Using sequential strings from a keyboard such as <tt class="docutils literal">qwerty</tt> or

<p class="handout">Some points to address in this list. Obviously, we covered why
dictionary words are a bad idea, words with numbers appended,
predictable sequences, such as from the keyboard or repeating
characters and words in the password and even predictable &quot;l33t&quot; speak
doesn't award you much strength.</p>
<p class="handout">The only item in that list that would deserve some mention are
Mnemonics, such as <tt class="docutils literal">BBslwys90!?</tt> from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B1gbRother|$alw4sriGHt!t?</span></tt>.
Notice that we substituted &quot;90&quot;, a right angle, for the word &quot;riGHt&quot;.
If used correctly, this creates a random string of characters that are
meaninful to you, but the attacker would not be able to guess. These
need to be used with care, as common phrases turned to mnemonics could
be easy to guess.</p>

<h1>Entropy</h1>
<ul class="slides simple">
<li>Measure of uncertainty</li>
<li>Total possible number of states a password can be in.</li>
<li>Represented in base-2.</li>
<li>Increasing the entropy of a password increases its strength.</li>
<li>Defined as: <tt class="docutils literal">H = L*log2(N) = <span class="pre">L*log(N)/log(2)</span></tt></li>
<li>H = number if bits in base-2</li>
<li>L = length of the message</li>
<li>N = number of possible symbols in the password</li>
<li>See table</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout container">
<p>Entropy comes from information theory, where entropy is a measure of
the uncertainty of the random variable. In essence, entropy quantifies
the expected value of information contained in a message.</p>
<p>For example, a fair coin has a entropy value of one bit. However, if
the coin is not fair, then the expected value is lower, due to the
uncertainty being lower. The entropy of a coin flip is given by the
binary entropy function.</p>
<p>Calculating entropy of a given password is given by the function:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">H = L*log2(N) = <span class="pre">L*log(N)/log(2)</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>where H is the resultant entropy of the password given in binay bits, L
is the length of the password and N is the number of possible symbols
in the password.</p>
<p>For example, the password <tt class="docutils literal">BBslwys90!?</tt> has a length of 11. It also
uses characters from the lowercases character set, uppercase character
set and the number and &quot;special character&quot; character sets. So, N=94, in
this case. Thus 11*log2(94)=72. This password has an entropy of 72
binary bits.</p>
<p>What this means is that a brute force password cracking utility would
have a search space of 2^72 or 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696 possible
passwords to search through for a 72-bit entropy password. Of course,
understanding probability means that the utility won't have to search
every password in the search space. It should stop when the password is
found, even if there are more passwords remaining.</p>

<p>Looking at the table above, the &quot;Entropy (H)&quot; column shows the desired
bit strength that you wish your password to have. For example, suppose
you wanted your password to have a bit strength of 80. Then, if your
password consisted of only numbers, it would need to be 25 digits long.
If you wanted your password to consist of all chracters from the entire
ASCII character set, then you would only need a password of 13
characters for 80 bits of entropy.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that your password does not contain the
entropy itself. Strictly speaking, any password contains zero entropy,
because it has already been chosen. This is difficult for must to
understand. The entropy comes from the system from which the password
was chosen. This is why in computer science, we typically refer to them
as &quot;entropy pools&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, entropy is becomes quite complex when human language is
involved. There is a famous estimate by Claude E. Shannon that English
text contains between 1.0 and 1.5 bits of entropy per letter. This is
known as &quot;Shannon Entropy&quot;. Because people are predictable, applying
this estimate to a password is questionable. In general, it's very hard
to give a good estimate on entropy, when human judgement is involved.</p>

<p>Revisiting at our passwords above, we can see the entropy bits of each
password. This should help put into perspective the relative strength of
each password.</p>
<p>Remember however, that bits doesn't necessarily mean that your password
can't be easily found given dictionary attacks, or other means as we
discussed earlier in this presentation. Randomization from any of the 94
possible characters is important.</p>
<p>Also, notice that just adding characters sets doesn't provide a great

</ul>
<div class="handout container">
<p>To put entropy into perspective, we can look at Distributed.net. On 19
October 1997, they found the correct solution for the RSA Labs 56-bit
secret-key challenge. The key was <tt class="docutils literal">0x532B744CC20999</tt>, and it took
them only 250 days to locate.</p>
<p>Then, on 14 July 2002 they found the winning key for the RSA Labs
64-bit secret-key challenge. That key was <tt class="docutils literal">0x63DE7DC154F4D039</tt> and
took 1,757 days to locate.</p>
<p>As of 03 December 2002, they are now working on the 72-bit RSA Labs
secret-key challenge. They are currently moving at a pace of about 300
billion keys per second. At that rate, it could take a maximum of
roughly 450-500 years. $1,000 USD will go to the finder of the key.</p>
<p>Of course, the laws of probability state that the likelihood of finding
the key tomorrow is the same as finding it in 500 years. But this
should give you an idea of the exhausting search that must be
maintained in order to crack a key of this size.</p>
<p>My personal opinion would be that your password should contain at least
60 bits of entropy. This will provide enough entropy to make your
search space large enough to frustrate most attackers, even with very
dedicated hardware, or a distributed attack.</p>
<p>However, as computing strengthens and newer, faster algorithms are
discovered, this isn't enough. Eventually, you well need 72-bits of
entropy then maybe 80-bits. So, the question remains, as time goes on,
how can you manage passwords with this much entropy?</p>

</ul>
<div class="handout container">
<p>The password card from <a class="reference external" href="http://passwordcard.org">http://passwordcard.org</a> is a way to generate
strong passwords with high entropy, make the password easy to remember,
have a unique password for each account that you have, and store the
passwords in a secure place; namely your wallet or purse.</p>
<p>When you visit the site, you will be presented with a form at which you
enter a valid hexadecimal number. It doesn't have to be something
complicated. If you recognize that the integers '0' through '9' are
valid hexadecimal numbers, then a number such as '42' would works just
fine. Also ,the letters 'a' through 'f' are valid hexidecimal numbers,
so something like 'dead', 'beef' and 'cafe' are all valid hexadecimal
numbers as well.</p>
<p>The point of the hexadecimal number is just in case you lose the card,
you can regenerate it with that number. This means that there exists
only one card for each number provided. The valid input range for the
hexadecimal number is anything from <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">ffffffffffffffff</tt>,
which means you could generate up to 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
password cards.</p>
<p>Once the card is generated, print it off, laminate it, and throw it in
your purse or wallet. Now, when you need a password for creating an
account, or wish to change existing passwords, pull out the card, find
a symbol column and row color that will help you remember the starting
location for the password, and go. Pick your destination and password
length. Then, everytime you need the password, just pull out your card,
and type it in. Eventually, if you use the password often enough.
you'll begin memorizing the password.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">There are a number of various password managers and secure password
generators that can be used when selecting a password that is high in
entropy. Some of the more common implementations are covered here:</p>
<p class="handout">KeePass- Keepass is a Free and Open Source password manager that is
available for Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, Android, iOS, Windows
Mobile, Palm and Blackberry. It stores passwords, as well as usernames,
URLs, and other information about the password in an AES-encrypted
database. The program can use two-factor authentication, requiring bot
a key and a passphrase to decrypt the database.</p>
<p class="handout">Password Safe- Password Safe is a utility written by cryptographer
Bruce Schneier. Initially released for Windows, there is a beta version
for GNU/Linux in the works. The program is Free and Open Source
Software, and it is praised for its simplicity in design. All passwords
are stored in a Twofish-encrypted database.</p>
<p class="handout">LastPass- LastPass is a popular secure password storage utility that
has emerged from the web. It is not Free and Open Source Software, but
instead is maintained under a proprietary license. LastPass is
available for Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, Android, iOS, Windows
Phone 7, WebOS, Symbian and Blackberry. There are also browser plugins
available. Passwords are stored in an AES-encrypted database.</p>
<p class="handout">For password generators, the following secure methods are popuplar:</p>
<p class="handout">pwgen(1)- Free and Open Source Software designed initially for UNIX and
unix-like systems, pwgen(1) is also now available for Windows. It can
generate passwords of any length, and is designed to generate passwords
are that easily memorized. It can also generate hard to remember,
&quot;secure&quot; passwords.</p>
<p class="handout">Diceware- Diceware is a physical way of generating secure, truly random
passwords. A list, known as the &quot;Diceware list&quot; is a pregenerated,
cryptographically signed, list of 7,776 words no longer than 6
characters. Each word is assigned a 5-digit number. A fair &quot;D6&quot;
(six-sided die) is rolled 5 times, and the numbers are recorded. The
five digit number is looked up to find the matching word. This word is
recorded, and the fair D6 is rolled again. This method is repeated as
many times as necessary, usually 5 or 6 times, creating that number of
words. The words are joined together to create the strong passphrase.</p>
<p class="handout">Every word in the Diceware list is lowercase. The entropy of each word
in Diceware is roughly log2(7776), or 12.9 bits. So, a passphrase of 5
words would have roughly 64.5 bits. See
<a class="reference external" href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html">http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="handout"><tt class="docutils literal">/dev/random</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">/dev/urandom</tt>- These are special character
devices that exist on most UNIX and unix-like operating systems.
<tt class="docutils literal">/dev/random</tt> collects data from exterior environmental noise, such
as typing on a keyboard or moving a mouse. The data is stored in an
entropy pool. Use of this device will take the data from the entropy
pool as its source of random data. When the entropy pool is exhausted,
<tt class="docutils literal">/dev/random</tt> will block the program from continuing, until enough
enivronmental noise has been added to the pool. <tt class="docutils literal">/dev/urandom</tt> is
similar to <tt class="docutils literal">/dev/random</tt>, except that it will not block the program,
but instead provide &quot;pseudorandom data&quot; as needed.</p>

<p class="handout">Encrypted filesystems give the added security and comfort that your
data cannot be compromised. Encrypted filesystems are becoming very
popular both in home use, corporate use and government use. Tools
exist for encrypting partitions, whole drives, removable media and
files, and these tools exist for all the major operating systems: Unix,
Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, BSD, etc.</p>
<p class="handout">Encrypted filesystems generally store and setup information in the
partition header pointing to a separate physical device before gaining
access to the soon-to-be decrypted data. Passwords/passphrases or
keyfiles are stored in databases on the physical device. As with
standard password databases, this password is salted and hashed as
well. This adds the extra benefit of security should the drive fall
into the wrong hands.</p>

<div class="slide" id="cold-boot-attack">
<h1>Cold Boot Attack</h1>
<ul class="slides simple">
<li>RAM data longevity</li>
<li>Freezing RAM</li>
<li>Cold Boot</li>
<li>Live booting methods</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/">http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">If the drive is successfully decrypted with the correct passphrase or
keyfile, then the passphrase/keyfile is stored in RAM by the kernel for
the duration of the uptime of the operating system. Unfortunately, many
of these encrypted filesystems keep the passphrase stored in plaintext
in the RAM registers.</p>
<p class="handout">Why is this unfortunate? Because RAM does not zero out immediately when
the power is cut. Rather, the contents of RAM are degraded slowly back
to their magnetic equilibrium. This can take up to 5 minutes on some
makes and models. Five minutes is more than enough time to read the
contents of the RAM after being pulled from the system and grab the
passphrase.</p>
<p class="handout">RAM also has another interesting characteristic. By dropping the
tempurature of the hardware chips, the duration it takes to zero out
the ram can be extended greatly- up to 15 minutes by just using a can
of compressed air.</p>
<p class="handout">So, how do you get at the contents of the RAM? Doesn't the operating
system wipe most of the registers when shutting down the system? Yes,
most definitely. As a result, we need to keep this from happening. We
can do so by using the cold boot method. This is done by holding down
the power button for a few seconds until the system powers off. At this
point, the contents of RAM are identical to the last time the kernel
assigned registers. We can now read its contents.</p>
<p class="handout">Reading the contents of RAM can be done with two methods:</p>
<blockquote class="handout">
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>1 Physically remove the RAM chips from the computer and insert into</dt>
<dd>a hardware module for reading the contents directly.</dd>
<dt>2 Boot off another medium, like a light LiveCD or LiveUSB, and</dt>
<dd>execute some applications designed for reading ram contents, and
saving the results to disk.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p class="handout">After examination of the RAM contents, the passphrase should be able to
be extracted from the file created by reading the chips.</p>
<p class="handout">It's important to note that this attack is only successful against
current running systems, or those placed in standby or hibernate, where
the RAM contents are being retained. If the computer has been turned
off for even 2-3 minutes, chances are not in your favor that you'll be
able to retrieve the key.</p>
<p class="handout">Rather than demonstrating this myself, take a moment to check out the
site at: <a class="reference external" href="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/">http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/</a>. Not only is there a video
presentation of the attack, but software for performing the attack as
well as papers and documenatation can also be found at that site.</p>

<div class="slide" id="evil-maid-attack">
<h1>Evil Maid Attack</h1>

<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pthree.org/?p=1175">http://pthree.org/?p=1175</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="handout">This attack is a platform, encrypted filesystem and hardware
independent attack on encrypted filesystems. The idea stems from the
fact that if you leave your laptop unattended, a &quot;hotel room maid&quot;
enters your room, and gets physical access to the computer. The maid
boots your computer from an external medium, and installs a hacked
bootloader with a keylogger.</p>
<p class="handout">When you return to your room, and boot the computer, you unknowingly
give the encrypted filesystem to the key logger. At this point, the
keylogger could install malware on your unencrypted disk and send the
passphrase over the network. It could store the passphrase on an
unencrypted part of the disk, or whatever. When the maid returns, she
has your passphrase and can decrypt and/or image the drive while you
are away.</p>
<p class="handout">The beauty of this attack, is there is no bullet-proof protection
against this sort of attack. Once you leave you computer unattended,
and someone else has physical access, all bets are off. No software,
hardware, or security device can protect you against this sort of
attack. There are steps you could take, every time you boot your
computer, but the amount of work and effort would be high on your part.</p>
